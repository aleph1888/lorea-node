#+TITLE: EZ Lorea Node Repository
#
#

* Introduction

  The lorea-node repository aims at providing a zero-click setup of a
  fully functional Elgg installation with the Lorea additions:

  + SSL support out of the box
  + The Lorea Framework: a set of Elgg plugins to add social network
    federation support with privacy in mind, such as
    - OStatus protocols for federation support
    - GPG-encrypted groups communication
    - TLS-only XMPP Server integration
    - [[https://bitbucket.org/rhizomatik/][More...]]
  + Desktop integration: scripts and tools to integrate with
    FreeDesktop.org
    - tray applet with drag'n'drop file upload capability and
      site notifications
  + An extensible lorea command for CLI

* Installation

  Get the [[https://github.com/lorea/lorea-node/raw/master/bin/bootstrap-lorea][bootstrap-lorea]] script and run it on your Debian-based
  system.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  wget --no-check-certificate -q -O- \
      https://github.com/lorea/lorea-node/raw/master/bin/bootstrap-lorea | bash
#+END_SRC

  Or clone the repository and run the script from lorea-node/bin/.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/lorea/lorea-node.git
  ./lorea-node/bin/bootstrap-lorea
#+END_SRC 

** Requirements

   - A Debian-based system
   - sudo privilege

* Usage

  Once installed, the *lorea* command will provide an interface to
  manage the Elgg installation, the Lorea toolset and the nodes
  themselves.

  To create a new node interactively, run =lorea node new=.  The
  interface is a bit raw but you want to at least:

  - set 2 LOREA_HOST to the domain of your node (can be anything for a
    local node, e.g. for testing or development.)
  - set 4 DB_NAME to the database name you want to use
  - set 7 DB_PASS to the database user password
  - set 8 DB_ROOT to the database root password

** SSL Support

   When you create a node, =lorea= will generate self-signed SSL
   certificates for your node with a lifetime of 3 months.  That
   should be plenty of time to get a proper SSL certificate from one
   of the friendly Certificate Authorities that provide gratis
   certificates for your website:
